# TravelSquad Project proposal

## Project Description
TravelSquad (working title) is an app that streamlines group trip planning. Users can create a group page, and poll each other on the key decisions for the trip.

## Problem statement
Have you ever tried to plan a trip with a group of your favorite people? You want to choose dates, the place to stay, the transportation and activities but the amount of brain damage you get from sending around all these emails starts to make the whole thing more of a chore than the trip of your dreams. Pretty soon you've got 400 emails flying around and it's hard to keep track of who's agreed to what and when, it feels like you should just give up.

## How will your project solve this problem?
TravelSquad streamlines this process by allowing you to poll your friends on travel choices easily, in one place. Simply add users to the group and drop in options, and they can come reply. TravelSquad makes it so everyone's voice is heard and when you head out on your dream trip everyone is on the same page.

## Map the user experience
A user will open up the app and touch 'create group'. They will enter in the names of each person in the group, and email address, and click 'create'. Then they will be taken to a view that shows options of types of vacation decisions, like dates, lodging, and activities. In the lodging option they can paste in an airbnb link and hit submit. On submit, a poll is generated that shows the main picture from airbnb, the price, and the title of the property. At the bottom of the app is a "share" button. When the user pushes this button an email is sent to each of the collaborators, with the link to the trip group.

Trip collaborators who receive the invitation email can click on the link, and will be brought to the page where they can make their selection on the poll. They will be greeted by instructions to make selections and there will be a line with their name, where they will choose from options such as "Favorite, Like it, Hate it, or Don't Care."

Any user can view this same page which will have the poll results, and use this information to book accommodations which is something that is external from TripTroop.

## What technologies do you plan to use?
React, Redux, Socket.io, CSS, HTML, PostgreSQL, Node, Express, Nodemailer
